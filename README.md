## DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

✅ Task 2: Content Marketing Strategy

In this task, I developed a complete content marketing strategy for Creamy Hub, with a focus on creating valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience. Content marketing is essential for long-term brand growth and organic traffic. It involves much more than just writing blogs — it's about understanding your audience, solving their problems, and delivering content across the right platforms.

This content marketing plan begins by identifying target audience personas such as students, parents, event planners, working professionals, and cake lovers. Each persona is defined by age, needs, interests, pain points, and how they interact with content online. Once the target audience is identified, the plan outlines key content pillars — including birthday celebration ideas, cake care tips, behind-the-scenes bakery processes, customer testimonials, seasonal recipes, and more.

A major part of the strategy is deciding content formats — such as blogs, Instagram posts, short-form videos (Reels), YouTube vlogs, infographics, and user-generated content. The document also includes a set of blog post topics tailored to the target audience, such as:

•	“Top 10 Birthday Cake Trends in 2025”

•	“How to Choose the Right Cake for Every Occasion”

•	“The Story Behind Your Favorite Cake Flavors”

Promotion channels for this content are carefully selected: SEO-optimized blog publishing, sharing via social media, email newsletters, collaborations with food bloggers/influencers, and using WhatsApp Business for direct communication. The strategy also covers content distribution frequency, editorial calendar planning, and engagement measurement techniques using metrics like traffic, bounce rate, and shares.

The deliverable is a clearly written Word/PDF file, presenting a comprehensive and actionable plan that Creamy Hub can implement to grow its content presence, improve organic visibility, and drive more sales.
